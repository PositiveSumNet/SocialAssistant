# Whosum Social Assistant + Chrome Extension

This is a free open source application to help you better engage with your social network relationships. Think of it as a DVR for caching online social networks and experiences, starting with Twitter.

Install it at the Chrome app store [from here](https://whosum.com/assistant) or use in developer mode [like this](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked).

*** IMPORTANT *** The video [here](https://whosum.com/assistant) provides an important installation tip on how to pin the toolbar button. (Otherwise, nothing happens.)

Development is led by [Positive Sum Networks](https://positivesum.net), a New York based non-profit. PSN, together with the open source community, is building a suite of apps and services under the name [Whosum](https://whosum.com). Per the Whosum launch video 
>"Who you are and who you know. We hold these WHOs to be self-evident as your property and your source of power." 

This project is for "who you know". After installing, go to Chrome -> More Tools -> Extensions and click Details. Then turn it on. You should see an icon with '+Î£'. Click it to get started:
- Record lists of Twitter followers/following
- Review and search within follow lists to find Mastodon profile links and other helpful data.

Curious about scraping web data? [Here](cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/what-the-hiq-vs-linkedin-case-means-for-automated-web-scraping/) is a good article about the HIQ v. LinkedIn case.

Twitter is just the beginning. Our roadmap calls for helping individuals to pull network data from the other major social sites. Data is stored within a private database right there in your browser (not on a server). How cool is that! (Optional sync features coming soon.)

We encourage developers to submit pull requests. We also look forward to collaborating with for-profit companies who share our vision of creating "digital robot butler" apps that *privately* leverage personal data as described [here](https://scafaria.com/planning-the-human-centric-web-1bcd2b275a81). PSN aims to create the patterns and infrastructure that will allow [new economic models](https://prosocialcapitalism.com) to thrive, free from surveillance capitalism and manipulative business practices. 

While this project is for "who you know", we invite you to also check out the Whosum ["possum passport"](https://whosum.com/prove) feature for portable identity ("who you are"). Together, these tools will allow decentralized and prosocial networking alternatives that extend experiences like Mastodon (which we also recommend!).
